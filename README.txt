A distaste for Powerpoint and a need to do a presentation led me to create this simple HTML5 based Slide Stack.
Easily modifiable using less CSS - see configurable settings in less file

Simple add sections to the stage to become slides.
Features include
	Configurable colors, backgrounds, logos 
	Keyboard navigation
	Top bar navigation.
